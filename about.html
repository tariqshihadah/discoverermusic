                <h3>A Musical Journal</h3>
                <p>
                    Discoverer is a musical project started by Tariq Shihadah to explore experiences, dreams, and the world around him. Discoverer isn't about contriving the perfect tune but about finding the songs already written inside us and in the communities we live in. The ambient, post-rock influenced music by this self-described "Midwest Folk" artist will draw you into a place of introspection and vulnerability. With graceful instrumentation and thought provoking lyrics, Discoverer asks you to come along for the journey to discover the music that lies waiting in our bones.

                <h3>In the Words of Others</h3>
                <p>
                    "Even with a name like Discoverer, it is fair to say that this one-man band has all the ironically undiscovered talent you could ever need. <br>
                    If you try to dig up information on him, you will not find much to satisfy your covetous needs. Tariq (Ricky) Shihadah describes his creative work as a “music journal” and we’re very much inclined to agree. When you listen to his latest album, I Wonder, it feels as though you’re almost intruding on something that should remain shrouded from the wandering eye. It’s personal, intimate, and altogether deceptively beguiling. <br>
                    Shihadah describes his music as something which covers the theme of not knowing, always wondering, and always discovering. The constant ambiguity and unpredictability of his music, although a self-described jumbled mess of confusion and incoherency, is definitely a strength in itself. It’s not anticipatory in its execution, and that is exactly why it works. He seeks not to impress anyone with bells and whistles, but rather with his heart laid bare on the strings of his guitar."

                    "[Discoverer] has a really genuine approach to music, a beautiful voice, and a very calming stage presence. He writes the kind of music that makes you sad… but in a good way."
